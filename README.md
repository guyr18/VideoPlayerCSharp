# VideoPlayerCSharp
VideoPlayerCSharp is a repository dedicated to a very basic implementation of the AxWindowsMediaPlayer control that
can be found in the Windows Media Player SDK. As implicited by the repository name, this is a video player
that plays a sample video.

I do not own the rights to the video used in this application. It is used for educational purposes only
as I attempt to understand the usage of the Windows Media Player SDK. You can run the software by 
launching the "VideoPlayer.exe" file.
